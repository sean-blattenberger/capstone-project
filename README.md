# :fork_and_knife: MenuSortr


MenuSortr is a food app designed to highlight the information user's want to find. Most food apps provide an opportunity to complain and criticize, and if there is something good to glean, you have to wade through all of the bad reviews or try to interpret ambiguous 5 star reviews. MenuSorter ranks restaurants and menu items in an ordinal manner based on user voting. Like Reddit, this allows users to find pertinent details about what they are looking at, namely what's popular, what's trending, and what isn't worth their time.
